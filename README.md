# Decentralized Assistive Technology Repair Network

## Overview

The Decentralized Assistive Technology Repair Network is a blockchain-based platform designed to transform how assistive devices are maintained and repaired. By connecting device owners with qualified technicians, tracking parts availability, and documenting successful repairs, we aim to extend the lifespan of critical assistive technologies and improve accessibility for all users.

## Core Features

Our network operates through four interconnected smart contract systems:

### 1. Device Registration Contract
- Records comprehensive details of assistive devices needing repair
- Documents device specifications, history, and current issues
- Creates a permanent, verifiable record of device provenance
- Enables status tracking throughout the repair process
- Stores device manuals and manufacturer specifications

### 2. Technician Matching Contract
- Connects devices with qualified repair specialists
- Maintains a verified registry of technicians and their expertise
- Implements reputation and rating systems
- Facilitates secure communication between users and technicians
- Coordinates scheduling and appointment management

### 3. Parts Inventory Contract
- Tracks availability of replacement components across the network
- Creates a decentralized marketplace for assistive device parts
- Documents part compatibility across devices and manufacturers
- Facilitates secure payment for components
- Enables part verification and authenticity confirmation

### 4. Repair Documentation Contract
- Shares successful repair methodologies and procedures
- Creates a knowledge repository of common fixes
- Allows technicians to document and publish repair guides
- Implements rewards for contributing valuable repair documentation
- Enables version control and peer review of repair procedures

## Technical Architecture

The platform is built on the Ethereum blockchain with four core smart contracts:

- `DeviceRegistry.sol`: Handles device registration and issue tracking
- `TechnicianMatcher.sol`: Manages technician profiles and matching algorithms
- `PartsInventory.sol`: Facilitates parts discovery and procurement
- `RepairDocs.sol`: Maintains the knowledge repository and documentation

Additional components include:
- IPFS integration for storing repair manuals and images
- OrbitDB for searchable repair history
- Layer 2 scaling solution for reduced transaction costs

## Privacy and Security

- Private user information is stored off-chain with encrypted access
- Device identifiers use a privacy-preserving hashing system
- Optional anonymized participation for sensitive assistive technologies
- Multi-signature approval for major repair decisions

## Community Governance

The network is governed by a diverse council representing:
- Device users and advocates
- Technicians and repair specialists
- Assistive technology manufacturers
- Disability rights organizations

Voting rights on protocol upgrades are distributed among active participants, with emphasis on balancing the needs of all stakeholders.

## Future Development

Planned enhancements include:
- Mobile app for field diagnostics and repair
- AR/VR interfaces for remote repair assistance
- Integration with 3D printing networks for custom parts
- Predictive maintenance alerts based on usage patterns
- Training programs for new technicians
- Subsidy integration for qualified users
